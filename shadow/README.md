# electra2shadow

This program displays a virtual version of the kinetic sculpture Electra 2 by Laurent Bolognini. It is controlled by specifying the form characteristics, i.e. the number of singular points, curvature, and pattern length for the 2 trajectories represented. It was designed to offer an alternative way to control the sculpture. Alternatively, the 3 motor rotation speeds can be directly controlled. See the file `config.example` for more information and a description of the configuration options. For more information, see also `../Exposition/presentation.svg`.

Usage: `stack run -- --config config.example`
